[Verse 1]
You gave my shirt back, I don't really get the meaning
It's like you're giving up before it all goes wrong
I've been told, but I don't really like the feeling
I've been away, I've been away too long

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I wanna go wherever you are
I-I-I wanna be wherever you are
I-I-I wanna see whatever you are

[Chorus]
You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass
But I think your heart is a muscle, your heart is a muscle
You gotta work it out, make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle, your heart is a muscle

[Post-Chorus]
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it will light up your eyes (Light up your eyes)

[Verse 2]
Wake the moon, we'll spend the night alone together
(Spend the night alone together)
You're a real good listener, but you don't have much to say
Wake up you, you won't pick up the phone, whatever
You're probably sleepin', I hope we're still okay

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I wanna go wherever you are
I-I-I wanna be wherever you are
I-I-I wanna see whatever you are

[Chorus]
You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass
But I think your heart is a muscle, your heart is a muscle
You gotta work it out, make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle, your heart is a muscle

[Post-Chorus]
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it will light up your eyes
If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it will light up your eyes
